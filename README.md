## About Me
Hey, I’m Alexandria. I grew up in York, Pennsylvania and have been into computers since I was about 5 or 6 years old. IT isn’t just something I want to do for work — it’s something I enjoy in my free time too. I’ve worked with Cisco, Ubiquiti, Windows, Linux, Apple, and iOS devices. 

When I’m not doing schoolwork, I’m usually setting up phone systems, playing with Active Directory, writing some code here and there, or diving into open source projects. Outside of tech, I like being outdoors and anything motorized — cars, bikes, and just about anything I can tinker with or upgrade.

> I’m a transgender woman. Please respect my name and pronouns. I only use my legal/deadname for official purposes.
